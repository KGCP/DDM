# Deep Document Model (DDM)

This repository contains the code for our research project titled "ASKG: An Approach to Enrich Scholarly Knowledge Graphs through Paper Decomposition". Our project's primary focus is to expand the academic knowledge graph automatically by extracting fine-grained knowledge from academic papers, particularly those related to computer science.
